# OmniFocus MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that integrates with OmniFocus to enable Claude (or other MCP-compatible AI assistants) to interact with your tasks and projects.

## 🌟 Overview

This MCP server creates a bridge between AI assistants (like Claude) and your OmniFocus task management system. It gives AI models the ability to view, create, edit, and remove tasks and projects in your OmniFocus database through natural language conversations.
Some ways you could use it: 

- Translate the PDF of a syllabus into a fully specificed project with tasks, tags, defer dates, and due dates.
- Turn a meeting transcript into a list of actions
- Create visualizations of your tasks, projects, and tags
- Process multiple tasks or projects in a single operation
- Bulk manage your OmniFocus items efficiently


## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- macOS with OmniFocus installed

### Connecting to Claude

1. In Claude Desktop, add this MCP server to your configuration file at:
```
~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

2. Add the following configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "omnifocus": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "omnifocus-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

3. Restart Claude Desktop

## 🌈 Use Cases

### Reorganize your projects, tasks, and tags
> "I want every task to have an energy level tag. show me a list of all the tasks that don't have an energy level tag and your suggestions for what tag to add. I'll make any changes I think are appropriate. Then make the changes in OmniFocus."


### Add tasks from any conversation

> "Ok, thanks for the detailed explanation of why the rule of law is important. Add a recurring task to my activism project that reminds me to call my representative weekly. Include a summary of this conversation in the notes field."

### Quick, Virtual Perspectives

Get a summary of your current tasks and manage them conversationally:

> "Show me all my flagged tasks due this week that don't mention "fish". 

### Process Transcripts or PDFs

Extract action items from meeting transcripts, academic research articles, or notes:

> "I'm pasting in the transcript from today's product meeting. Please analyze it and create tasks in OmniFocus for any action items assigned to me. Put them in my 'Product Development' project."

### Batch Operations

Manage multiple items efficiently:

> "I have a list of 20 tasks from this meeting transcript. Please add them all to my 'Q2 Planning' project with appropriate tags and due dates."

## 🛠 Development

Documentation to follow.

## 🧠 How It Works

This server uses AppleScript to communicate with OmniFocus, allowing it to interact with the application's native functionality. The server is built using the Model Context Protocol SDK, which provides a standardized way for AI models to interact with external tools and systems.
